# Removing Manifests from a Cluster

To remove the manifests from your cluster, run:

```bash
aspirate destroy
```

You will first be presented with all the context names (unless you have passed one in as a cli option) in your kubeconfig file, and will be asked to select one.
This will be used for removal.

If you have a secret file, these secrets will be removed as well. This command does not prompt for a password, as secrets do not need to be decrypted to be removed from your cluster.
